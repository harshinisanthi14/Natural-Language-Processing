## 1. Sentiment Analysis:
 This model identifies the sentiment behind text as positive, negative, or neutral. It is widely used in reviews, social media, and customer feedback to understand user emotions and opinions toward products or services.

## 2. Text Classification:
 Text classification assigns predefined categories to text data, like spam detection, topic labeling, or intent recognition. It helps in organizing, filtering, and processing large text datasets efficiently for automation.

## 3. Summarization:
 Text summarization condenses large texts into shorter versions while preserving key information. Itâ€™s useful for reading lengthy documents, news, or articles quickly without losing the essence of the original content.

## 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER):
 NER detects and classifies entities like names, places, organizations, and dates in text. It's used in information extraction, knowledge graph building, and document tagging for search and analysis.

## 5. Translation:
 Translation models convert text from one language to another while preserving meaning and context. Useful in multilingual applications, global communication, and cross-language content understanding.

## 6. Question-Answering:
 QA models find precise answers to questions from a given context or document. They're used in search engines, chatbots, and educational tools to retrieve relevant information quickly and accurately.

## 7. Vanilla Chatbot:
 A vanilla chatbot is a basic conversational AI that responds to user input with predefined or generative replies. It handles simple interactions without deep context understanding or advanced reasoning.

## 8. Gradio Application:
 Gradio creates simple, interactive web apps for ML models. It allows users to test tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, or QA through user-friendly interfaces without needing to write complex frontend code.
